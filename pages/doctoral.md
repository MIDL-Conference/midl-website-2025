Dr. Yuan received his B.S. in physics at Beijing Normal University and his Ph.D. in Biomedical Physics at the University of Utah. He became Senior Research Analyst of GE Medical Systems immediately thereafter. He has pioneered multiple high-resolution MRI techniques to detect vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques and led numerous single and multi-site MRI studies examining carotid atherosclerosis.   He serves as a NIH grant reviewer and was the chairperson of NIH ANIE study section (2021-2023).  He is also a manuscript reviewer for many peer review journals focusing on magnetic resonance, arteriosclerosis, stroke, and cardiovascular sciences.
 
Throughout his 30+ years at the University of Washington, he has mentored over 80 graduate and postdocs who have moved on to become professors, chief research scientists, clinician-researchers, heads of departments and other positions of responsibility in both private and government or public institutions in the USA, Asia, Europe, and around the world.

# Managing Medical Imaging Datasets: From Curation to Evaluation

High-quality data is the foundation of any successful machine learning pipeline, especially in the medical domain. This workshop will explore cutting-edge techniques for managing medical imaging datasets, with a focus on synthetic data generation, data curation, evaluation, and more.

In the first half of the session, you will hear from leading researchers and practitioners who are transforming their medical imaging workflows through smarter data practices. In the second half, join us for a hands-on tutorial using the open-source tool FiftyOne to load, visualize, curate, and evaluate medical imaging datasets across various modalities.

Whether you're a researcher, clinician, or ML practitioner, this workshop will give you practical tools and insights to elevate your work with medical data.

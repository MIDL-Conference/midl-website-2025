# Managing Medical Imaging Datasets: From Curation to Evaluation

**High-quality data is the backbone of impactful medical AI.** This workshop explores the full lifecycle of medical imaging datasets—from smart curation strategies and synthetic data generation to robust evaluation techniques. You will gain exposure to cutting-edge research and hands-on tools that are reshaping how imaging data is managed in medical AI workflows.

In the first half, leading researchers and practitioners will share best practices in dataset quality control, synthetic data generation, and reproducible evaluation. In the second half, participants will take part in a hands-on tutorial using [**FiftyOne**](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone), a powerful open-source toolkit, to explore and curate datasets across modalities such as X-ray, MRI, CT, and ultrasound.

Whether you are a researcher looking to improve dataset integrity, a clinician collaborating on AI development, or an ML engineer scaling healthcare models, this session offers practical insights and tools to level up your work with medical imaging data.
